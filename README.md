First of all, leave your star 🌟 on this repo.

## Features Checklist + Challenges

- Web API

  - [x] it should have an endpoint for storing heroes' data

    - [ ] it should test all files on the factories layer
    - Plus
      - [ ] it should reach 100% code coverage (it's currently not possible to get code coverage metrics using only the native Node.js, see [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) for this task)
